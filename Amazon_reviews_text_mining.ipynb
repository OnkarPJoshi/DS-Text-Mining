No cheating.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Delivered on time and the product was as per specs. No cheating.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n4.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn\\'t have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don\\'t sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn\\'t be a problem for normal users.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It\\'s a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I\\'m not a photography enthusiast, but they\\'re good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it\\'s been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you\\'re going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple\\'s \"\"walled garden\"\" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Nice and small phone. Good for showing off.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n4.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a powerful and ultra smooth Device and no doubt on that. As far as size is concerned it is lovely and fits in the hand and pocket with super ease.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Handy and easy to use with single hand.

I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn\\'t have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don\\'t sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care.

There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance.

No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I\\'m not a photography enthusiast, but they\\'re good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it\\'s been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive.

I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care.

My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care.

I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone.

No cheating.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n4.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn\\'t have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don\\'t sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn\\'t be a problem for normal users.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It\\'s a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I\\'m not a photography enthusiast, but they\\'re good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it\\'s been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you\\'re going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple\\'s \"\"walled garden\"\" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Nice and small phone.

I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn\\'t have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don\\'t sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care.

No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I\\'m not a photography enthusiast, but they\\'re good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag.

I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn\\'t have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don\\'t sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn\\'t be a problem for normal users.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n4.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Let me sum up my mind here.

No cheating.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n4.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn\\'t have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don\\'t sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn\\'t be a problem for normal users.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It\\'s a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I\\'m not a photography enthusiast, but they\\'re good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it\\'s been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you\\'re going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple\\'s \"\"walled garden\"\" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Delivered on time and the product was as per specs.

I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn\\'t have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don\\'t sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn\\'t be a problem for normal users.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It\\'s a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I\\'m not a photography enthusiast, but they\\'re good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it\\'s been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you\\'re going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple\\'s \"\"walled garden\"\" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Nice and small phone.

My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care.

I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn\\'t have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don\\'t sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn\\'t be a problem for normal users.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It\\'s a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I\\'m not a photography enthusiast, but they\\'re good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it\\'s been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you\\'re going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple\\'s \"\"walled garden\"\" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Nice and small phone.

My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn\\'t be a problem for normal users.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It\\'s a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I\\'m not a photography enthusiast, but they\\'re good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it\\'s been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you\\'re going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple\\'s \"\"walled garden\"\" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Nice and small phone.

I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn\\'t have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don\\'t sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don\\'t like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn\\'t hurt my eyes. So I don\\'t really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn\\'t be a problem for normal users.\\n  \\n\"\\r\\n5.0 out of 5 stars,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It\\'s a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I\\'m not a photography enthusiast, but they\\'re good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it\\'s been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you\\'re going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple\\'s \"\"walled garden\"\" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones.

an work phone iphone sebeing a sony xperia user since sony arc times i didnt have a choice to move away form the sony portfolio as they dont sell in india anymore my xz1 is still working after 55 years but she is getting old and i repeat i hate iphonesafter much deliberation between 12 13 and 13 mini i went with 13 mini1 i really wanted a phone i could use in a single hand it fits perfect2 i got a great deal on the purchase as the net amt i paid was rs 58900 after card discounts so it is cheaper than a lot of android phones with high end configuration3 performance it is smooth and fast4 face id works i dont like it but it works i miss the touch id but i knew what i was getting so no complains5 the starlight colour is beautiful i love whites6 camera is brilliant i am a point shoot not a camera buff my sony xz1 camera is 5 years outdates so this is refreshing7 the only pain point is inability to transfer whatsapp from android to iphone i knew this so not a surprise but still a pain8 sound i come from a xz1 front stereo experience not many phones have that sound quality this phone is top quality so i am satisfied with the quality9 display i still love lcd panels but this is pretty sharp and bright i love it10 notch it doesnt hurt my eyes so i dont really care again i knew what i was gettingif you are a power user and concerned about battery having a power bank may be useful but i feel it shouldnt be a problem for normal users prosform factor is unmatched there is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use pocketability and

disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs it’s a powerful and ultra smooth device and no doubt on

handedbattery life is amazing compared to most android flagships not as good as the iphone pro max but still more than sufficientperformance is snappy no stutters lags or freezes whatsoeverdisplay is great high resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density no high refresh rate thoughcameras are ok im not a photography enthusiast but theyre good enough for point and click not as good as my note20 ultra but doableconsios is a mixed bag i get the distinct impression that its been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite personally i prefer that i can customise an os for my usage rather than me adapting to it but some people prefer it that wayrepairs are exorbitantly expensive a case and a protector is absolutely necessaryapple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extraif youre going to use this as a primary device for media consumption see the phone inperson first the display is small and you might find it smaller than you expectedoverall i feel given apples walled garden nature most of the iphones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones and if you just want an iphone that works flawlessly for calls texts emails and social media the iphone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iphone range nice and small phone good for showing off its really a cool mobile only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs it’s a powerful and ultra smooth device and no doubt on that as far as size is concerned it is lovely and fits in the hand and pocket with super ease handy and easy to use with single hand battry life is average camera is perfect product is just fantastic but why 4 stars the cameras do not support macrocloseup shots my iphone se 128gb 1st generation from 2018 cost me 34k works and does it better apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers anything and everything been a iphone user earlier also was skeptical about purchasing a relatively expensive product online but amazon service turned out to be flawless you dont need a big phone for big power and the iphone 13 mini proves it with  some of the best cameras and performance in the business if you’re coming for a small phone this is basically the best you can getgoodgreat performanceversatile camerassharp bright displayvery portable and convenientstriking design  beautiful lightweight
